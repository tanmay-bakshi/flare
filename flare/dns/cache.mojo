"""TTL-bounded DNS resolution cache.

An additive layer over the sync :func:`flare.dns.resolve`: a value-type
cache the caller owns and threads through repeated lookups. Within a
host's TTL a lookup is served from memory with no ``getaddrinfo(3)``
syscall; past the TTL the next lookup re-resolves and refreshes the
entry. The sync ``resolve`` / ``resolve_v4`` / ``resolve_v6`` functions
are untouched -- callers that do not want caching pay nothing.

```mojo
from flare.dns import DnsCache

var cache = DnsCache(ttl_ms=30_000)
var a = cache.resolve("example.com")   # one syscall
var b = cache.resolve("example.com")   # served from cache, no syscall
print(cache.resolve_count())            # 1
```

This is a single-threaded value type (the owner serializes access); it
has no internal lock. A shared cache across reactor workers could reuse
the same pointer-backed interior-mutable handle pattern as
``flare.http._client.alt_svc.AltSvcStore`` plus a mutex, layered on top
of this pure cache without changing its logic.
