"""Per-connection state machine for HTTP/2 inside the reactor.

Symmetric counterpart to :class:`flare.http._server_reactor_impl.ConnHandle`
for HTTP/2: owns one accepted ``TcpStream``, drives a
:class:`flare.http2.server.Http2Connection` over non-blocking
``recv`` / ``send`` syscalls, dispatches every completed stream's
request through the user's :class:`flare.http.Handler`, and queues
the response frames back through the same socket. The state-machine
shape (``on_readable`` / ``on_writable`` returning a
:class:`StepResult`) is byte-for-byte identical to the HTTP/1.1
``ConnHandle`` so the unified
:class:`flare.http.server.HttpServer` reactor loop dispatches both
connection types via a single ``StepResult`` translator
(``_apply_step``).

State transitions (mirror ConnHandle):

::

    STATE_READING  -- response queued -->  STATE_WRITING
    STATE_WRITING  -- write_buf flushed --> STATE_READING (h2 multiplexes)
    STATE_READING  / STATE_WRITING -- peer FIN / error --> STATE_CLOSING

Unlike HTTP/1.1, h2 connections are persistent and multiplex many
streams concurrently: ``on_readable`` may dispatch multiple
``handler.serve(req)`` calls per event (one per ``stream id``
that finished within the inbound bytes) and the connection stays
open after the response flushes. Only an explicit ``GOAWAY`` or a
peer FIN moves to ``STATE_CLOSING``.

The constructor pre-loads the H2 server's initial SETTINGS frame
into ``write_buf`` so the very first ``on_writable`` after the
client preface arrives flushes both the SETTINGS and the
SETTINGS-ACK in one syscall.
