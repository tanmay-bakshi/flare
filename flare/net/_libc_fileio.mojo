"""Raw read/write for non-socket fds (pipe, eventfd) - split out of ``_libc``.

``_recv`` / ``_send`` in ``flare.net._libc`` only work on sockets. Eventfd and
pipe require plain ``read(2)`` / ``write(2)``. We route through ``flare_read`` /
``flare_write`` exposed by ``libflare_tls.so`` because Mojo's stdlib also
declares ``external_call["read" / "write", ...]`` for ``FileDescriptor`` with a
different signature, and the two collide at the MLIR lowering stage. The C
wrappers compile to a single tail-call; no measurable cost.

Both platforms load the library on demand via ``OwnedDLHandle``:

- macOS: SIP blocks ``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`` for non-signed binaries, so a
  preload-style injection is impossible.
- Linux: Mojo's JIT symbol resolver does **not** look at ``LD_PRELOAD``ed
  globals - it only searches the small set of shared objects it opened
  itself. So even on Linux we must ``dlopen`` via ``OwnedDLHandle`` to get a
  callable pointer.

Two call shapes are provided:

* ``FlareRawIO`` - a cached handle + function-pointer struct. Owners (like
  ``Reactor``) construct one at init time and call ``io.read() / io.write()``
  on the hot path. No dlopen/dlsym per call.
* ``_read_fd`` / ``_write_fd`` - thin module-level helpers that open the
  library per call. Convenient for one-off use from tests and non-hot-path
  call sites; do **not** use in anything that runs per-request or per-wakeup.

These names are re-exported from ``flare.net._libc`` so existing
``from flare.net._libc import FlareRawIO`` call sites keep working unchanged.

# the eventfd / self-pipe. Doing ``dlopen + dlsym + dlclose`` per wakeup
# is measurable under churn (Stage 2+ multi-threaded wakeup, the
# ``fuzz_reactor_churn`` workload). ``FlareRawIO`` opens the library and
# resolves ``flare_read`` / ``flare_write`` exactly once - subsequent
# I/O is a plain indirect call through the cached function pointer.
#
# Ownership invariant: the ``OwnedDLHandle`` field keeps the library
# mapped for the lifetime of the struct, so the cached function
# pointers stay valid. Moving the struct moves the handle + pointers
# together. ``Copyable`` would be wrong because duplicating an
# ``OwnedDLHandle`` would double-free on destruction.
