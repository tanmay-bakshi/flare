"""libc time FFI.

Mojo has an empirically-observed anomaly when calling ``usleep``
via the inferred-signature overload of ``external_call``:
``usleep(c_uint(1000))`` (1 ms
expected) sleeps for ~1.5 seconds, and ``usleep(c_uint(50_000))``
(50 ms expected) sleeps for ~56 seconds. The exact root cause
hasn't been pinned down but the symptoms are consistent with a
register-width / type-coercion mismatch somewhere in the
``external_call`` path.

The fix is to bind libc time primitives ourselves with explicit
``Int32`` / pointer-to-``Int64`` signatures and stop relying on
``std.ffi.c_uint``. Both functions in this module are tested
empirically against monotonic-clock differences in
``tests/test_libc_time.mojo`` so any future regression is caught
in-tree rather than slowly through drain-test wall-time growth.

POSIX semantics:

- ``usleep(useconds_t usec)`` — suspends the calling thread for
  at least ``usec`` microseconds. ``useconds_t`` is uint32 on
  Linux + macOS. Values >= 1_000_000 are explicitly undefined;
  callers wanting >= 1 second should use ``nanosleep`` instead.
  Returns 0 on success, -1 on signal interruption.

- ``nanosleep(const struct timespec *req, struct timespec *rem)``
  — suspends for ``req->tv_sec`` seconds + ``req->tv_nsec``
  nanoseconds. No upper limit. Returns 0 on success, -1 on
  signal interruption (with ``rem`` populated with the remaining
  time).
